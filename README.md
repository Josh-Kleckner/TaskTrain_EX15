## Project Description  
This repository documents my second externship with the *TaskTrain* app, where I rejoined a new team of 12 to conduct a focused QA cycle targeting core features and integrations.

- **Test Case Execution:** Wrote and executed 45 test cases and supported the validation of multiple Gherkin-based test suites.  
- **Bug Reporting:** Logged 11 bugs in Jira, all low-severity, with detailed reproduction steps and supporting evidence.  
- **Gherkin Feature File Validation:** Reviewed and validated existing feature files, identifying potential mismatches between expected behavior and written scenarios.
- **UI/UX & Usability Heuristics:** Evaluated interface behavior and user experience, noting issues related to button formatting, click zones, and overall heuristic alignment.    
- **Execution Report:** Authored and presented a comprehensive test execution report detailing findings, pass/fail rates, and recommendations for launch readiness.
